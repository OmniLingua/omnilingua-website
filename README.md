# OmniLingua

OmniLingua is a modern, global-first translation agency based in Ireland that leverages a distributed team of professional translators from around the world to offer cost-effective, high-quality translation services. Our model connects clients in high-cost countries with skilled translators in lower-cost regions — creating value on both sides.

## 🌍 Key Features

- 📜 Document translation in multiple languages
- 👩‍💻 Remote translator hiring model
- 💼 B2B and B2C translation services
- ✅ Legally compliant contracts for remote workers
- 🔒 GDPR and data privacy aligned processes

## 🏢 Business Model

We employ professional translators from countries with lower operational costs and deliver high-quality translations to clients in Ireland, the EU, and other higher-cost regions. The margin between the translation service cost and the client pricing drives our revenue.
